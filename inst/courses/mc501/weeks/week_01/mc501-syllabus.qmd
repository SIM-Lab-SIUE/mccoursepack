### Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy is grounded in the constructivist theory of learning, which emphasizes active student engagement and reflection as key to constructing knowledge. I am committed to creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment that accommodates diverse learning needs and fosters student success. This philosophy guides my approach to teaching, where I focus on providing practical skills and conceptual frameworks that empower students to navigate and succeed in the ever-evolving field of mass communications. I integrate technology into my teaching to ensure that students are equipped with the most current tools and practices, and I continuously adapt my methods based on student feedback to maintain educational excellence.

### Communicating with the instructor

Other than class or in-person office hours, I am also available electronically through three methods.

Email: [aleith\@siue.edu](mailto:aleith@siue.edu)

-   Preferred method for time-insensitive and confidential communication.

Discord: [APLeith](https://discord.gg/zWrSzR2)

-   Preferred method for time-sensitive or casual communication.

Zoom: [Zoom Scheduler](https://scheduler.zoom.us/ap-leith)

-   Preferred method for long-form or high-interaction communication.

# About the Course

## Course Description

This graduate course is designed to give you basic proficiency in a variety of research techniques that mass communication professionals use to gather information to make decisions or understand a phenomenon.

## Course textbooks

The book for this course is an OER textbook hosted through GitHub. A stable version of the textbook will be hosted in a GitHub repository. For the updated readings for each week, you will be able to access them using the course package in RStudio. Please save the address of the package, as you will need it multiple times a week. Additional readings will be accessible in the weekly download through the package.

## Other course materials

***Software***

This class uses various software to collect, analyze, and visualize data. The software will be available on the classroom computers; however, it is also beneficial to install it on your personal computer to gain experience.

-   R: A free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and macOS.
-   RStudio: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python. RStudio runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
    -   Windows 10 or newer
    -   macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer, Mac M1/M2 requires Rosetta 2

***Hardware***

You are expected to have access to a computer that adheres to the SIUE Mass Communications [recommended laptop requirements](https://www.siue.edu/arts-and-sciences/mass-communications/for-students/laptop-recs.shtml). Even if the classroom has computers available, you will likely need to acquire access to a personal computer to complete all coursework. File management is also essential for this course. You will have access to GitHub for version control; however, I also recommend saving everything to your personal computer and a secondary system. The secondary system can be either an external storage device (e.g., USB, HDD, or SSD drive) or a cloud drive (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive), so you can limit data loss. You are unlikely to be accessing large amounts of data, so a 16GB jump drive with USB 2 or higher should be sufficient. I believe an upgrade to USB 3.0 or higher is worth the few extra dollars.

# Course Requirements

## Course activities/assessments

All course activities are intended to prepare you for the final paper and presentation. This will include selecting a topic, analytical exercises, and writing.

## Submitting work

Submissions will always be done through Blackboard. Please review assignment instructions to ensure you submit files in the correct format.

## Technology requirements

Technical requirements for students can be found in this [ITS KnowledgeBase article](https://kb.siue.edu/104656).

# Course Policies and University Policies

## Academic integrity/plagiarism

Students are reminded that the expectations and academic standards outlined in the [Student Academic Code (3C2)](https://www.siue.edu/policies/3c2.shtml) apply to all courses, field experiences and educational experiences at the University, regardless of modality or location.

Plagiarism is using another person’s words or ideas without crediting that person. Per the [SIUE academic dishonesty policy](https://www.siue.edu/policies/table-of-contents/1i6.shtml), plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated and may lead to failure on an assignment, in class, or dismissal from the University. Students are responsible for complying with University policies about academic honesty as stated in the [University’s Student Academic Conduct Code](http://www.siue.edu/policies/3c2.shtml).

## Diversity and Inclusion

SIUE is always committed to respecting everyone's dignity. To learn, exchange ideas, and support one another, our virtual and physical classrooms must be places where students and teachers feel safe and supported. Systems of oppression permeate our institutions and our classrooms. All students and faculty have the responsibility to co-create a classroom that affirms inclusion, equity, and social justice, where racism, sexism, classism, ableism, heterosexism, xenophobia, and other social pathologies are not tolerated. Violations of this policy will be enforced in line with the SIUE Student Conduct Code.

The [Inclusive Excellence, Education, and Development Hub](https://www.siue.edu/diversity/the-hub/ "https://www.siue.edu/diversity/the-hub/") is an excellent resource for students for support and community.

## Grading Deadline

Unless otherwise stated, the deadline for all assignments is Friday by the end of the day (11:59 p.m.).

## Grading Rubric\[s\]

Grading rubrics are very minimal. They are mostly presented as checklists. You will start at full credit and then lose full or partial points for each incorrect item. The checklist will ask you to complete specific tasks and explain how you accomplished them. You are also welcome to contact me with any point disputes. In special cases, you can also address mistakes for partial credit.

## Feedback and Grading Timeline

I hope to post grades with itemized feedback by the Monday following the due date. You can find your grade by clicking the My Grades link on the left menu of the Blackboard course. The itemized feedback is intended to point you to the erred point. Please contact me for any additional clarity.

## Late or Missed Assignments

Late submissions are docked 10% from the maximum grade for each business day (e.g., not weekends or holidays) it is late. The maximum deduction is 50%. You can submit late work up to two weeks after the due date. Any later requires prior approval from the professor.

## Resubmissions

I will provide a weeklong window from the posted due date for resubmissions. If you resubmit, your new grade is the average of the two submissions. The resubmission does not receive the same point reduction. If you submit your assignment late, it is your responsibility to inform me that it was submitted if you are planning to do a resubmission.

## Participation

This course works best with the respectful exchange of ideas, including being sensitive to the views and beliefs expressed during online discussions. Success in this course is closely linked to attendance and participation (e.g., asking questions, participating in activities). I also recommend self-study to ensure the retention of these new skills.

## Regular and Substantive Interaction

Regular and substantive interaction (RSI) is required as part of new US Department of Education regulations for distance (online) education and it supports student learning in all learning environments (online, face-to-face, hybrid, hyflex, etc.). SIUE faculty participate in RSI by initiating frequent and timely opportunities to engage with students. RSI may look different in every class because there are several ways to implement RSI, such as facilitating online discussions, scheduling a Zoom conference with a student, or holding regularly scheduled review sessions before tests. To learn more about RSI, use the Online Tips links for Faculty and Students in your Blackboard course websites or visit the [Faculty Resources for Regular and Substantive Interaction webpage](https://www.siue.edu/educational-outreach/faculty-resources/online/regular-and-substantive-interaction.shtml).

## Recordings of Class Content

To assist with accessibility, I have begun recording course content via Zoom. These recordings will be available through links on Blackboard. These recordings are not an excuse to miss class, as attendance will still be taken.

## Diversity and Inclusion

SIUE is always committed to respecting everyone's dignity. To learn, exchange ideas, and support one another, our virtual and physical classrooms must be places where students and teachers feel safe and supported. Systems of oppression permeate our institutions and our classrooms. All students and faculty have the responsibility to co-create a classroom that affirms inclusion, equity, and social justice, where racism, sexism, classism, ableism, heterosexism, xenophobia, and other social pathologies are not tolerated. Violations of this policy will be enforced in line with the SIUE Student Conduct Code.

## Subject to change notice

All material, assignments, and deadlines are subject to change with prior notice.  It is your responsibility to stay in touch with your instructor, review the course site regularly, or communicate with other students, to adjust as needed if assignments or due dates change.
