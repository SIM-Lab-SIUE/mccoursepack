\title{Download a week's template into a destination directory}
\usage{
download_week(course, week = NULL, dest = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{course}{Course name (e.g., "mc451", "mc501"). For back-compat you may
pass only \code{week} as the first argument if exactly one course is installed.}

\item{week}{Integer or string like \code{"01"} or \code{"week_01"}.}

\item{dest}{Destination directory (created if needed). Defaults to current dir.}
}
\value{
(invisibly) a list with \code{dest}, \code{course}, \code{week}, and \code{n_copied}.
}
\description{
Copies the installed files for a given \code{course} and \code{week} into \code{dest}.
If the week template is empty (e.g., holiday weeks), this succeeds quietly
and copies nothing.
}
\details{
Backward compatibility: if you call \code{download_week(1, dest)}, it assumes there
is a single installed course and uses it. If multiple courses exist, you must
supply the \code{course} argument.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use a temporary folder in examples/checks (portable on Windows)
d <- tempdir()
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = d)
}
